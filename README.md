# BroadBulletin

BroadBulletin is a small web application, designed to make it easier for people to read the same topic of news from different, contrasting sources.

This project was created for the "Filter Bubbles" unit on the BA (Hons) Web Media course at Ravensbourne. The objective for this unit was to create a small web application that helps people "burst" outside of their filter bubble and discover new things.

The API used for this project is the [WebHose API](https://webhose.io).
